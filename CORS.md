# Server side configuration for MP4/FLV/WebM progressive download

## 1. Verify current CORS settings

Instrcuctions for verifying and configuring CORS settings for different web servers are below. 

If you have any questions, email cdn-help [at] hola [dot] org, or skype:holacdn

### 1.1 Most web servers

Hola free bandwidth saver and CDN work by requesting your MP4/FLV/WEBM files from the video server in chunks. For this to work, certain HTTP headers need to be enabled.

Test to see if your HTTP server is configured correctly by using:

```curl -v -H "Origin: <site origin link>" -X OPTIONS -H  "Access-Control-Request-Headers: range" <link to MP4/FLV/WEBM file>```

Another way to quickly to see if your HTTP server is configured correctly is using the Chrome develope console. Open the 'network' tab, load your page, and click on the line with the MP4. In the 'headers' tab look at the response headers.

In both cases, the desired response is:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 0
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: HEAD, GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Range, Date, Etag
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Origin, Accept, Range, Cache-Control
Access-Control-Max-Age: 600
Timing-Allow-Origin: *
```

If the response is different from the desired response, configure the missing headers by enabling CORS on the web server(s) that is serving the video files. Go line by line to ensure all headers are configured correctly.

### 1.1 Amazon web servers

If you are using Amazon S3 to store videos, you should configure your bucket to allow cross-origin requests, you create a CORS configuration, an XML document with rules that identify the origins that you will allow to access your bucket, the operations (HTTP methods) will support for each origin, and other operation-specific information. 

Test to see if your HTTP server is configured correctly by using:

```curl -v -H "Origin: <site origin link>" -X OPTIONS -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: range" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" <link to MP4/FLV/WEBM file>```


## 2. Configuring CORS headers

### 2.1 Most web servers

For step by step instructions regarding how to enable CORS on different web servers, see the [[original CORS documentation](http://enable-cors.org/server.html)] (http://enable-cors.org/server.html). Make sure you add all the required headers, not just '*' referenced in the generic instructions.

After committing the configuration changes, verify response that headers to from this server(s) include required headers, as described above.

### 2.2 Amazon web servers

Note: If the bucket used to store the video files is not the same bucket used to store the page that loads the video, then the following must be configured for all related buckets.

1. From your Amazon AWS console go to S3.
2. Select the relevent bucket and show it's properties.
3. Click 'Edit CORS Configuration' and paste the XML below:
```
<CORSConfiguration>
 <CORSRule>
  <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
  <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
  <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>

  <AllowedHeader>Content-Type</AllowedHeader>
  <AllowedHeader>Origin</AllowedHeader>
  <AllowedHeader>Accept</AllowedHeader>
  <AllowedHeader>Range</AllowedHeader>
  <AllowedHeader>Cache-Control</AllowedHeader>
  
  <ExposeHeader>Content-Range</ExposeHeader>
  <ExposeHeader>Date</ExposeHeader>
  <ExposeHeader>Etag</ExposeHeader>
  
  <MaxAgeSeconds>600</MaxAgeSeconds>

 </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

After committing the configuration changes, verify response that headers to from this server(s) include required headers, as described above.

If you require a more in-depth guide to customizing your S3 bucket configuration, please see [Amazon documentation] (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html).
